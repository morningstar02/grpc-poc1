# grpc-poc1


##gRPC is a modern, open source, high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication.

##Like many RPC systems, gRPC is based on the concept of defining a service in terms of functions (methods) that can be called remotely. For each method, you define the parameters and return types. Services, parameters, and return types are defined in .proto files using Google's open source language-neutral protocol buffers mechanism.
